# a1ConstraintSatisfaction

a1ConstraintSatisfaction is assignment 1 for comp560 at UNC

HOW TO RUN:
My project consists of 5 main files, please download these:
    - BackTracker.py
    - BackTrackerMain.py
    - LocalSearch.py
    - LocalSearchMain.py
    - State.py
    
 You must run each search individually. Sorry for the trouble, I simply found it easier to implement separate 'main' methods

To run Backtracker in the shell, use the command:
    python BackTrackerMain.py filename.txt

Or for LocalSearch:
    python LocalSearchMain.py filename.txt:
    
filename.txt is the name of the input file you wish to run my code on.
Please note that I have included test files in my repository that should be the same format as the official test files.

My programs output directly to the terminal.
The following is the output format:
    SearchName Output:
    Number of Steps = ###
    State Color
    State Color
    State Color
    State Color
    etc.
